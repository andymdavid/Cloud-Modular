      "Cloud Modular is ideal for residential estates, apartment buildings, commercial developments, mixed-use projects, and social infrastructure like schools or healthcare facilities. The system adapts to most building types that need speed, quality, and scale.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the manufacturing process take?",
    answer:
      "Manufacturing typically takes 4-8 weeks depending on project size and complexity. Multiple modules are fabricated concurrently, significantly reducing total timelines.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the installation timeline?",
    answer:
      "On-site installation usually ranges from 1-4 weeks. Because modules arrive largely complete, installation is rapid and minimally disruptive.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are designs customizable?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We collaborate on layouts, finishes, and configurations to match your project while retaining the efficiencies of modular construction.",
